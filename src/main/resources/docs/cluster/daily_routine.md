I want to go through DSA, System Design + Scala + Akka + Play FrameWork. 

I've prior knowledge about Scala Basics + Akka Basics + Play Basics. 

I want to complete this in next 30 days. 

How to plan it out. 

my DSA Topics are: 

1. Recursion. 
2. Arrays
3. Searching.
4. Sorting. 
5. Matrix
6. Hashing
7. Strings
8. Stack
9. Queue
10. Deque
11. Tree
12. BST
13. Heap. 
14. Graph. 
15. Greedy. 
16. Backtracking
17. DP.
18. Trie. 
19. Segment and Indexed Binary Tree
20. Disjoin Set. 

for scala, System Design, Akka, Play you can create your own understanding. 

I want to solve 4-5 questions for coding problems daily to catch up fast. 

This all needs to be completed at max 35 days. 

So today is 24 of may -. by june end this should be complete. 

I also have a responsiblity of a Job that I need to give 3 hours there. also need to attent 2 meetings 10 am and 6 pm. ( 30 mins each )

can you create plan based on that? 

Below is how I imagine a perfect day for me. 

I woke up drank water, got to washroom ( 10 -12 mins freshen up ). 

I went for running/ exercising. ( 2.5 km run ). ( around 25 mins ). 

then I came back drank water went to bath. then I ate something. 

then I started my day for career goals. 

then I can wake up for 5-10 mins after each 1 hours / 1.5 hours for small breaks. ( drink water ). 

had breakfast ( 20- 30 mins ). 

again went to career goals, 

attend meeting at 11 am for office ( remote ). 

then again back to career goals. 

in office hours ( 10: 30 am to 6 : 30 pm ) I will only dedicate 2-3 hours of work to office. ( if necessary). 

other than that I will focus on my career goals ( As I have been laid off ). 

now, I will eat lunch at around 1:30 pm ( 30 mins ) rest for 20 - 30 mins. 

then again back to work / career goals. 

similarly I want to go ahead having the snacks at around 4:30 - 5:30 pm ( 20 - 25 mins ). 

then once I shut my office  laptop at around ( 6:30 )

I want to rest for 20 mins. then get back to work and meanwhile I want to keep drinking water every 1 hours. 

and then I will eat dinner at around 8 pm. 

then I will study for 2 more hours then I will create a plan for tomorrow and will be on bed by 10:30 pm. 

this is how I imagine myself. 


so take this as context, I might be wrong at some places but you can create a plan for me on the basis of this. 

so can you create a weekly goals for me ( so that overall goals should be met ). 

also create a daily routine for me.
