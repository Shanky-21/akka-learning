  # Note: The akka.actor.deployment block below was for actor names
  # "myBoundedActor" and "myPriorityActor" and was referencing
  # incomplete dispatcher definitions.
  # Since your MailboxDemoApp.scala creates actors named "boundedActor"
  # and "priorityActor" and assigns dispatchers programmatically using
  # .withDispatcher("bounded-mailbox-dispatcher") and
  # .withDispatcher("priority-mailbox-dispatcher"),
  # that deployment block is not affecting these actors.
  # We will define the dispatchers with the names used in the code.
  #
  # If you wanted to use deployment configuration for actors named
  # "boundedActor" and "priorityActor", it would look like:
  # actor.deployment {
  #   "/user/boundedActor": { # Path matches the actor created in MailboxDemoApp
  #     dispatcher = "bounded-mailbox-dispatcher" # Refers to the full dispatcher below
  #   }
  #   "/user/priorityActor": { # Path matches the actor created in MailboxDemoApp
  #     dispatcher = "priority-mailbox-dispatcher" # Refers to the full dispatcher below
  #   }
  # }
}

# We will put the mailbox-type directly into the dispatcher config,
# which is the most common and usually correct way.

  # (Settings, Config) constructor that Akka's Mailboxes utility will use.
